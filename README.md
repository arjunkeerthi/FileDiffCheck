# FileDiffCheck
**Scans and identifies differences between two files.**

To use, run from your command prompt following the format below:

>`filediffcheck.py [-nostrip] [-file] file1 file2 [output file]` 

`file1` and `file2` are the two files to be compared and `output file` is the optional file to which comparison data is written.
If files are not located in current directory, the relative file path must be provided.

For convenience, `-ns` may be used in place of `-nostrip`, and `-f` in place of `-file`.
